        <h3>Discription</h3>
     
        <p>Idli or idly (/ɪdliː/ ⓘ) (plural: idlis) is a type of savoury rice cake, 
        originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.
        </p>
        Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from semolina. 
        Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
