        <h3>Discription</h3>
     
        Poha, also known as pauwa, sira, chira, chivda, avil or avalakki, among many other names, 
        is flattened rice originating from the Indian subcontinent. 
        Rice is parboiled before flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking.
        These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, 
        milk or any other liquids. The thickness of the flakes varies from almost trans
        lucently thin (the more expensive varieties) to nearly four times thinner 
        than a normal rice grain.
